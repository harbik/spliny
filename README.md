# Spliny: Working with Spline Curves

[Spine curves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spline_(mathematics)) are piecewise polynomial (parametric) curves, 
used for interpolation, curve fitting, and data smoothing.

`Spliny` is a (tiny) pure Rust library for using spline curves, based a `spliny`'s knots and control points in `SplineCurve<K,N>`,
and to plot splines --currently limited to 1 and 2D splines-- to check the results.
It does not fit spline functions to data-sets: see the `Splinify`-crate  for that purpose.

# Example 1: Lissajous Curve Fit
Get a spline curve for a Lissajous-dataset, with plot and JSON representation:
<center>
<img src="https://www.harbik.com/img/dierckx/lissajous.png" height="800"/>
</center>

```rust
use splinify::{CubicSplineFit2D, Result};

fn lissajous(t:f64, a: f64, kx: f64, b: f64, ky: f64) -> [f64;2] {
    [
        a * (kx * t).cos(),
        b * (ky * t).sin()
    ]
}

fn main() -> Result<()> {

    // Generate Lissajous data points, with angle parameter `u`
    // ranging from 0 to 180ยบ, with 1ยบ-steps.
    let u: Vec<f64> = (0..=180u32).into_iter().map(|v|(v as f64).to_radians()).collect();
    let xy: Vec<f64> = u.iter().flat_map(|t|lissajous(*t,1.0, 3.0, 1.0, 5.0)).collect();

    // fit Cubic Spline with Splinify's CubicSplineFit
    let s = CubicSplineFit2D::new(u, xy)?.smoothing_spline(5e-3)?;

    // Output fit results as JSON file and plot
    println!("{}", serde_json::to_string_pretty(&s)?);
    s.plot_with_control_points("lissajous.png", (800,800))?;

    Ok(())
}
```

# Example 2: 4 Control Point Cubic Spline

Here a Cubic Spline is constructed from 4 control points:
<center>
<img src="https://www.harbik.com/img/dierckx/cubic2d.png" height="800"/>
</center>

```rust
use spliny::{CubicSpline2D, Result};

pub fn main() -> Result<()> {

    let spline = CubicSpline2D::new(
        vec![1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 2.0, 2.0, 2.0, 2.0],
        vec![0.0, 0.5, 1.0, 3.0, 2.0, -3.0, 3.0, -3.0]
    );

    spline.plot_with_control_points("cubic2d.png", (800,800))?;

    Ok(())
}
```
The control points are 4 control point: (0,2), (.5,-3), (1,3), and (3,-3), and the curve has 8 knots.



# Usage

Spliny is developed as part of a family of three crates but can be used independently too:

- **splinify** fits (non-uniform) [B-Spline](b-splines) curves to input data,
and results in a fitted as a `spliny`-crate `CurveSpline`.
Data inputs are `x` and `y` vectors for 1 dimensional curves,
and `u` and `xyn` vectors in case of N-dimensional curves.

- Use **spliny** to to use the generated splines, for example to calculate curve coordinates, or a spline-curve's derivatives.
This package also implements basic tools for input and output of spline representations in form of JSON files, and spline plots.
It is completely written in Rust, and does **not** require a Fortran compiler. 

- **dierckx-sys** contains Fortran foreign function interfaces to Paul Dierckx' FITPACK library. 
It is used by `splinify`, but ---unless you want to explore Paul Dierckx library yourself--- can be ignored as concerned to using `splinify` and `spliny`.

To use this library add this to your `Cargo.toml` file:

```
[dependencies]
spliny = "0.1"
```

# Spline Curve
The base spline representation in `Spliny` is the `SplineCurve<K,N>` object ---a wrapper for a vector of knots, and
fit coefficients--- with *K* the spline degree, *N* the space dimension of the curve spline.

For convenience, the following aliases have been defined:

|          Alias        | K | N |
|-----------------------|:-:|:-:|
| `LinearSpline`        | 1 | 1 |
| `CubicSpline`         | 3 | 1 |
| `QuinticSpline`       | 5 | 1 |
| `LinearSpline2D`      | 1 | 2 |
| `CubicSpline2D`       | 3 | 2 |
| `QuinticSpline2D`     | 5 | 2 |
| `LinearSpline3D`      | 1 | 3 |
| `CubicSpline3D`       | 3 | 3 |
| `QuinticSpline3D`     | 5 | 3 |
